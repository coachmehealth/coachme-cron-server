# Twilio-Response-BE

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend deployed at

heroku.com <br>
https://coach-me-cron.herokuapp.com/

---

### Backend framework

-   Node.js, Express, http, and cronjob gives us the flexibility and functionality needed to create a fully functional custom server that is tasked with intercepting incoming sms messages from coachme patients as well as dispatch scheduled messages from the https://coach-me-development.herokuapp.com backend.
-   We are going to use http with express to create a listening server that can intercept incoming sms messages and a cron function that can pull data from the coachme backend endpoint /twilioRoute/getAllScheduledMessages every minute and send an sms messages according to their send time stamps.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ CronJob function

_Description_

-   Pulls scheduled messages data from the /twilioRoute/getAllScheduledMessages endpoint every minute using node-cron (for timed execution of the function) and axios (for the url request to the coachme backend).
-   Messages are dispatched according to three possible formats:

_Example_: query (weekly)

```javascript
{
    "patientId": "recmLlbDsUaCMUFhf",
    "msg": "hello good morning!",
    "min": "09",
    "hour": "2",
    "ampm": "pm",
    "weekday": "Tuesday",
    "dom": "",
    "month": "",
    "year": "2019"
}
```

_Example_: query (Monthly)

```javascript
{
    "patientId": "recmLlbDsUaCMUFhf",
    "msg": "hello good morning!",
    "min": "09",
    "hour": "2",
    "ampm": "pm",
    "weekday": "",
    "dom": "12",
    "month": "",
    "year": "2019"
}
```

_Example_: query (None repeat)

```javascript
{
    "patientId": "recmLlbDsUaCMUFhf",
    "msg": "hello good morning!",
    "min": "09",
    "hour": "2",
    "ampm": "pm",
    "weekday": "",
    "dom": "12",
    "month": "Nov",
    "year": "2019"
}
```

-   Message dispatch logic for monthly includes an if statement with an equality operator that checks whether the time information in the dom, hour, min, and ampm fields are equal to the current pacific time as defined by the moment() function. moment() has been set to display time as `13 4:05 PM`.
-   Message dispatch logic for weekly includes an if statement with an equality operator that checks whether the time information in the weekday, hour, min, and ampm fields are equal to the current pacific time as defined by the moment() function. moment() has been set to display time as `Tuesday,6:06pm`.
-   Message dispatch logic for none repeat includes an if statement with an equality operator that checks whether the time information in the month, dom, year, hour, min, and ampm fields are equal to the current pacific time as defined by the moment() function. moment() has been set to display time as `Nov 13, 2019 4:05 PM`.
-   Intended inputs for min, hour, and ampm fields are `00 - 60`, `1 - 12`, and `am - pm` respectively.

_Bugs_

-   Currently the messages that are scheduled weekly are set to repeat while messages that are scheduled monthly only are dispatched once. Will need to create a new column in the scheduledMessages table that will say whether a message has been sent or should be sent. Will need to find a better way to dispatch scheduled messages.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

-   PORT
-   JWT_SECRET (jsonwebtoken secret )
-   ACCOUNT_SID (Twilio account special id)
-   AUTH_TOKEN (Twilio account authentication token)
-   TWILIO_NUMBER (Twilio sender number)
-   SERVER_SECRET (Secret string. Used to authenticate /twilioRoute/getAllScheduledMessages get requests)
